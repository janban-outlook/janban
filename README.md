# ⚠️ PROJECT STATUS: UNMAINTAINED ⚠️

After many years of development and maintenance, I have decided to retire from active development of JanBan. As I no longer use Windows or Office personally, I've been unable to maintain the project for the past few years. 

I initially thought I might pick up development again after my retirement, but after consideration, I've decided not to purchase Windows and Office licenses or set up a new development environment specifically for this purpose.

**What this means:**
- The repository has been migrated from GitLab to GitHub to increase visibility
- No new features will be implemented by me
- I will not be able to respond to support requests
- The application is stable in its current state with no major known issues

**For users:** Thank you for your interest and support over the years. The current version should continue to work as is.

**For developers:** This project is now open for adoption! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, or use it as a foundation for a new version. If you're interested in becoming a maintainer or creating your own fork, please feel free to do so.

I'm grateful to everyone who used JanBan and found it helpful for their workflow. While it's difficult to step away, I hope this project can continue to evolve through the open source community.

The JanBan Outlook Taskboard is a kanban board style view for Outlook Tasks.

This project is based on [Evren varol's Outlook Taskboard](https://github.com/evrenvarol/outlook-taskboard).
I have added a lot of features, customization and configuration options.
